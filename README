To install just copy sfgame in /var/www.

For run type path to web folder. ie http://localhost/sfgame/web.

TEST in sfgame dir:
Unit test run: symfony test:unit game
Functional test run: symfony test:functional game defaultActions
or just: symfony test:all

Enjoy!


This is not an MVC project (there is no Model).
Game logic and forms are in apps/game/lib.
Game class define and perform all game logic.
Default Action just call Game class and set vars for templates.

My code only do requirements for: # What we ask you to do
